          Many of my roles—assistant teacher, computer tutor, Livingstone tutor,
          and KenSAP mentor—were centered on helping young people learn, grow,
          and build confidence.

          Whether teaching digital literacy, guiding academic strategies, or helping
          students understand new technologies like AI, I have always focused on
          empowering youth to recognize their potential.
        </li>

          I believe youth flourish when given support, guidance, and meaningful
          opportunities to challenge themselves.
