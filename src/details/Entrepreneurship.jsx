          I am driven by the challenge of identifying needs and building solutions that
          create social value. My experiences across teaching, solar sales, and mentorship
          shaped a mindset centered on problem-solving and opportunity creation.
        </li>

          Working in roles that required resource management, communication, and
          initiative taught me to think like a builder—someone who turns ideas into
          practical action.
        </li>
        <li>
          Entrepreneurship, for me, is a commitment to elevating communities by designing
          systems and opportunities that did not exist before.
