          I lead by example—through service, initiative, and consistency. My leadership
          experiences span academic mentorship, club management, community engagement, and
          classroom support.

          As chair of the Lenana School chess club, class representative, and peer tutor,
          I learned how to guide teams, motivate others, and communicate effectively.

          Leadership to me is about lifting people, creating order amid uncertainty, and
          making decisions that help others succeed.
