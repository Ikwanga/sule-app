          My curiosity constantly pushes me to explore new technologies, ideas, and
          methods of learning—from artificial intelligence to digital tools used in
          education and youth empowerment.

          Teaching an AI course at KenSAP deepened my desire to understand how emerging
          technologies reshape society and how young people can adapt to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          I see innovation as the courage to question assumptions, test possibilities,
          learn from failure, and continually refine ideas.
