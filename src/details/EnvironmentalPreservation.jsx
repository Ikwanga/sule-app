          My interest in the environment was shaped by years of studying Geography and
          visiting Kenya’s natural landmarks—where I learned how landscapes influence
          communities, livelihoods, and national development.
        </li>
        <li>
          I am deeply interested in how environmental resources can be preserved,
          understood, and used responsibly to benefit future generations.
        </li>
        <li>
          I believe environmental decisions must balance human needs, ecosystem
          protection, and long-term sustainability.
